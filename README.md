# peer-reviews
Alumni reviewing alumni projects

## Stage 1 -- collection of ideas
- projects as valuable part of nanodegrees: feeling of accomplishment plus valuable feedback
- alumni can submit projects for others to comment on
- they are encouraged to contribute their project descriptions to a public library of possible projects


## Stage 2 -- find out if there's enough interest in the alumni community
- survey? just start?

## Stage 3 -- define workflow and necessary tools / technology
- github pull requests
- reviewer guidelines (be kind, be helpful)
- 
## Stage 4 -- write code ;-) (if necessary at all)
- at least a web site explaining the process
